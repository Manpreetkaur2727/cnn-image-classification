# CNN Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model classifies images from a dataset into 6 categories. The dataset used in this project is a subset of images divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Description

This repository contains code to train a CNN model for classifying images into six categories. The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers. The training process includes data augmentation and normalization to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.

### Data

The dataset used consists of images in 6 different classes, and the data is split into training, validation, and test sets. 

## Setup

To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manpreetkaur2727/cnn-image-classification.git
